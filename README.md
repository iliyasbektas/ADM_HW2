Here I do basic analysis of E-commerce data in Kaggle. 
I used two files, October and November from E-commerce data in Kaggle. Also, I used initial 10^6 rows from each file to finish exerscices faster. 
Then, I planned to run larger files but overall it did not have major effect on stats analysis essentially except some parts.
