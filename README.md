# ADM_HW2

Firstly, I did the whole homework by myself. So, there is no need for peer view and etc. 

I used two files, October and November. Also, I used initial 10^6 rows from each file to finish exerscices faster. 
Then, I planned to run larger files but overall it did not have major effect on stats essentially except some parts. 

I will attach two graphs that show larger picture for larger data.
