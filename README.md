# ADM_HW2

Just FYI, I did the whole homework by myself. So, there is no need for peer view and etc. 

I used two files, October and November. Also, I used initial 10^6 rows from each file to finish exerscices faster. 
Then, I planned to run larger files but overall it did not have major effect on stats analysis essentially except some parts. 

I will attach two graphs that show larger picture for larger data for parts that were affected (site popularity throughout the days and weeks RQ5). 

N.B. Overall, I think that the data was too large for an introductory pandas and numpy exercise. I spent much time struggling just to download and read.
There is much data in kaggle that is just as good for analysis.
